Here are the three problems that i have encountered today.

1. you get an array of appointments like {{3,5},{1,2},{2,7},{6,8}}
  Our job is to find out all the conflicting schedules
  here in the above case {2,7} conflits with {3,5} and {6,8}.
  
2.  Given a NxN matrix (maze) where all the elemnts are characters 1=wall, 0=path, m=mouse and e=exit.
  Find the path from m to e.
  
3. Given a state diagram, that represents the events of a video player. Implement this state diagram using appropriate
  Datastructure.

	
	finding number of 1 bits in a binary number
	
	for example: 1011 has three 1's in it. 
	
	implemented in number_of_ones.cpp using an algorithm of Wegner (1960) that repeatedly finds and clears the lowest-order nonzero bit.
